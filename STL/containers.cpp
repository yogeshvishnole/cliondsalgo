// What are containers?

/*
 *  Containers are objects that stores a collection of data , using a well defined data struture.
 *
 *  Examples --> vectors, stack ,queue , map, set , pairs etc
 *
 *  Classification of containers
 *
 *  containers are of two types
 *
 *  1. Sequential --> one after other
 *  2. Associative --> In the form of key and value ( also called as associative arrays)
 *
 *  sequential examples
 *
 *  vectors, stack ,queue , list ,deque , array
 *
 *  Associative conatiners
 *
 *  two types
 *
 *  1. Ordered  (Balanced binary search trees are used O(logn))
 *     Examples set , map, multiset , multimap
 *  2. Unordered ( Hashmaps are used O(1))
 *    Examples unorderes_set, unordered_map , unordered_multiset etc
 *
 *    Lets see some containers
 *    1. Vectors --> Dynamic arrays
 *    2. array --> simple array
 *    3. list --> doubly linked list
 *    4. forward_list --> singly linked list
 *    5. dequeue --> doubly ended queue can push and pop from both ends
 *
 *
 *   Container Adapters
 *
 *   Interfaces that implements special functionality on top of Sequence containers
 *
 *   Stack  dequeue
 *   queue  dequeue
 *   priority_queue using vectors in the form of heap
 *
 *   Unordered containers
 *
 *   set
 *   Model of mathematical set {x1,x2,x3,x4}
 *   Collection of unique elements that serve as keys
 *
 *   four possibilities
 *   set
 *   unordered_set
 *   multiset
 *   unordered_multiset
 *
 *   map
 *   set of pairs {(k1:v1),(k2:v2),(k3:v3)}
 *   four possibilities
 *   map
 *   unordered_map
 *   multimap
 *   unordered_multimap
