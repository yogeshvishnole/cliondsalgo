// Some notes

/*
 *1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort
6. Heap sort
7. Count sort
8. Shell sort
9. Radix sort
10. Bucket sort


Classification of sorting algorithms

1. Time complexity  → example o(n2) algorithms , O(logn) algorithms etc.
2. Space complexity   → inplace O(1) space , outplace -> memory grows with input size
3. Stability → Order of duplicate elements preserved in stable algorithms , and not preserved
 in non stable algorithms.
4. Internal or external sort → internal takes place in RAM , external if input size is
 large then need disk that supports that that algos are called external.
5. Recursive or non recursive → algorithms that uses recursion are called as recursive
 algos ex → merge sort  , quick sort. , that not ussesrecursion are non recursive algoss.
