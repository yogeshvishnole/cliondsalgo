/*
 * Binary Search Tree
 *
 * It is a search optimized version of Binary Tree.
 * It is make search optimized by putting some constraints
 * on how nodes will go inside the binary tree.
 * In BST every node data is unique ( no duplicates ) as duplicates
 * increase the search time.
 * for each node the value of data inside it is --
 *          1. always greater than all the data values of its left sub tree
 *          2. always less than all the data values of its right sub tree.
